# Kaprekar's Constant

From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/6174_(number))

> 6174 is known as Kaprekar's constant[1][2][3] after the Indian mathematician D. R. Kaprekar. This number is notable for the following rule:

> 1. Take any four-digit number, using at least two different digits. (Leading zeros are allowed.)
> 1. Arrange the digits in descending and then in ascending order to get two four-digit numbers, adding leading zeros if necessary.
> 1. Subtract the smaller number from the bigger number.
> 1. Go back to step 2 and repeat.
> The above process, known as Kaprekar's routine, will usually reach its fixed point, 6174, in at most 8 iterations.[4] Once 6174  is reached, the process will continue yielding 7641 – 1467 = 6174. For example, choose 3524:

> * 5432 – 2345 = 3087
> * 8730 – 0378 = 8352
> * 8532 – 2358 = 6174
> * 7641 – 1467 = 6174 
> The only four-digit numbers for which Kaprekar's routine does not reach 6174 are repdigits such as 1111, which give the result 0000 after a single iteration. All other four-digit numbers eventually reach 6174 if leading zeros are used to keep the number of digits at 4.

## What to do
