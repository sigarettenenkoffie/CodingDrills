[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture)

## What to do
1. Take any positive integer x
1. In case if it is even, divide it by two, otherwise triple it and add 1
1. Repeat step 2 until you reach 1

## Extra
* Both recursive and iterative approach
* Count how many iterations it takes for x to converge to 1
