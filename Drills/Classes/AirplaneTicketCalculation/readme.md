# Airplane ticket calculation

Create a user-interface that expedites the calculation of airplane ticket costs based on :

* total number of passengers 
* booking as group or family, 
* age (child, adult, senior), 
* date of departure (off-season, holiday, regular), 
* date of arrival (off-season, holiday, regular), 
* frequent-flyer membership (basic, premium, platinum), 
* booking date, total number of passengers, 
* domestic versus international travel, 
* type of payment (cash, wire transfer, credit-card). 

All data-entry Controls must prevent entering any non-meaningful character given the context, and must perform validation.

All internal logic processing is to be performed using Enumerations (enum) and switch statements ... unless ... you present a compelling reason not to use this strategy."
