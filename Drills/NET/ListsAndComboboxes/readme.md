Based on a List<string> that holds a number of Categories, and a List<List<string>> that holds a number of Items: 
* create a user-interface where the Categories are in one ComboBox, 
* and a second ComboBox has its contents determined by which Item in the first ComboBox is selected: 
* the Index of the first ComboBox's selected Item is used to select the List from the List<List<string>>
